## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (v20 or higher recommended)
- **[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)**
- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)**
- **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)**

## üöÄ Installation

This project is designed to be run with Docker. The following steps will get your development environment up and running.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/connects-college/college-connect.git](https://github.com/connects-college/college-connect.git)
    cd college-connect
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Copy the example environment files. These are pre-configured for the Docker setup.

    ```bash
    # For common services like Postgres & MinIO
    cp .env.example .env

    # For the Next.js app in development
    cp .env.local.example .env.local
    ```

3.  **Build and start the services:**
    This single command will build the necessary Docker images and start all the services defined in `docker-compose.yml` for the development environment.

    ```bash
    pnpm docker:dev:up
    ```

    The first run might take a few minutes to download images and build containers. Subsequent runs will be much faster.

4.  **Access the application:**
    Once all services are running, you can access them at:
    - **üåê Main Application**: [http://localhost](http://localhost)
    - **üóÑÔ∏è MinIO Console**: [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) (Use credentials from `.env`)
    - **üìÄ Prisma Studio**: [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555)

That's it! The entire stack, including the database, object storage, cache, and the Next.js app with hot-reloading, is now running.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The project uses a multi-layered `.env` file system for configuration:

- `.env`: Defines common environment variables for infrastructure services managed by Docker Compose (e.g., PostgreSQL and MinIO credentials).
- `.env.local`: Contains variables specifically for the Next.js application in the **development** environment. This file is used by `app-dev`.
- `.env.production`: Contains variables for the Next.js application in the **production** environment. This file is used by `app-prod`.

**Note:** For file uploads to work correctly through the Nginx reverse proxy, two separate MinIO endpoint URLs are used:

- `MINIO_ENDPOINT`: The internal Docker network address (`http://minio:9000`) for server-to-server communication.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MINIO_ENDPOINT`: The public-facing address (`http://localhost:9000`) that the browser uses to upload files to pre-signed URLs.

## üê≥ Docker Usage

The entire application stack is managed via Docker Compose profiles to separate development and production environments.

### Development

The `dev` profile is designed for local development with hot-reloading and debugging tools.

- **Start all development services:**
  ```bash
  pnpm docker:dev:up
  ```
- **Stop all development services:**
  ```bash
  pnpm docker:dev:down
  ```
- **View logs from all services:**
  ```bash
  pnpm docker:dev:logs
  ```
- **Run a database migration:**
  This command executes `prisma migrate dev` inside the running application container.
  ```bash
  pnpm docker:db:migrate
  ```

### Production

The `prod` profile builds a hardened, optimized, and multi-stage Docker image for the Next.js application.

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Before you start:**
  1.  Copy the production environment file: `cp .env.production.example .env.production`.
  2.  **Change all default passwords and secrets** in `.env` and `.env.production`.

- **Build and start production services:**

  ```bash
  pnpm docker:prod:build
  pnpm docker:prod:up -d # The -d flag runs the containers in detached mode
  ```

- **Stop production services:**
  ```bash
  pnpm docker:prod:down
  ```
